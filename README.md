# Building an Advanced Virtual Lab with pfSense, Kali, VulnHub, Metasploitable, and Active Directory

## Introduction
I am in the process of enhancing my virtual lab setup in VirtualBox. The new configuration includes integrating pfSense as a router and firewall. This advanced setup will incorporate Kali Linux, various VulnHub VMs, Metasploitable, and an Active Directory environment, all operating within isolated networking. This lab is currently under construction and aims to provide a comprehensive platform for learning and testing cybersecurity skills.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a more sophisticated virtual lab environment that can simulate real-world network scenarios. This setup will be ideal for practicing penetration testing, network security, and system administration skills in a controlled and safe environment.

## Components of the Lab
The virtual lab will consist of the following components:

1. **pfSense**: Serving as the central router and firewall to manage network traffic and security policies.
2. **Kali Linux**: A powerful penetration testing platform with a wide range of security tools.
3. **VulnHub VMs**: Various vulnerable machines from VulnHub for practical penetration testing.
4. **Metasploitable**: An intentionally vulnerable machine designed for training and practicing penetration testing techniques.
5. **Active Directory Environment**: To simulate a corporate network environment and practice AD-related security testing.

## Initial Step: Setting Up pfSense VM
The first and crucial step in building this lab is to set up the pfSense virtual machine. pfSense will act as the backbone of the lab, managing network segmentation and security. It will be configured to handle different network zones, including separate segments for Kali, VulnHub VMs, Metasploitable, and the Active Directory environment.

### Subsequent Steps
After establishing the pfSense VM, the following steps will involve:

- Configuring network interfaces and rules in pfSense.
- Setting up the Kali Linux VM with necessary tools and configurations.
- Importing and configuring VulnHub VMs for penetration testing practice.
- Installing and setting up Metasploitable for additional security testing scenarios.
- Creating and configuring an Active Directory environment for advanced network and security practice.

## Conclusion
This virtual lab, once completed, will offer a versatile and dynamic environment for honing cybersecurity skills. It will allow for a wide range of security testing and network management scenarios, providing an invaluable tool for learning and experimentation in the field of cybersecurity.
